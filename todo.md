# Snake game todos/maybes

## bugs
1. not to allow to move in direct opposite direction (eg. cant go down when moving up )

## game modes
- wrap wall
- solid wall
- relax/zen - no death (wrap wall + no death hitting self)
- wallLess/infinite


## styling correction 
- make it responsive + make it playable on phone(by implementing **swipes** through js)
- top 3 high scores
- would be better if use flex to keep board written stuff separate
