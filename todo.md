# Snake game todos/maybes

## bugs
1. ~~not to allow movement in direct opposite direction (eg. cant go down when moving up )~~ --> **fixed**
2. food appearing ON the snake

## game modes
- wrap wall
- solid wall
- relax/zen - no death (wrap wall + no death hitting self)
- wallLess/infinite


## styling correction 
- make it responsive + make it playable on phone(by implementing **swipes** through js)
- ~~top 3 high scores~~ **done**
- ~~would be better if use flex to keep board written stuff separate~~ **done**
